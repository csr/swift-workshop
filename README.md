## Welcome to the Swift Workshop Repository! 

This course teaches you about the Swift language and how to create an iOS app from scratch using Xcode. You can find the files of the previous sessions here in case you need to catch up. Brought to you by [Iulia Baltoi](github.com/julyb) & [Sorin Cioban](github.com/sorinc03). Cesare De Cal is helping out. Together we'll be building a puppies app!

### Session 1

We went through the Swift language, Swift Playgrounds and we built our first app featuring a puppy! Please find the files [here](https://github.com/csr/swift-workshop/tree/master/Session%201) if you need to catch up with the session project.

### Session 2

We explored the power of AutoLayout, stack views and table views. Please find the files [here](https://github.com/csr/swift-workshop/tree/master/Session%202/Puppies).

### Session 3

We did a coding challenge! Let's see if we can build a list featuring all the puppies. 3... 2... 1.. go! Don't worry, we'll be helping out along the session.

### Session 4
 
We reviewed the coding challenge and introduced new concepts such as navigating between view controllers using navigation controllers and animations.
